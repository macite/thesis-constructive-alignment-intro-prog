\section{Constructive Alignment} % (fold)
\label{sec:constructive_alignment}

Constructive alignment, as proposed by \citet{Biggs:1996c}, is an amalgamation of constructive learning theory and aligned instruction design. It aims to elicit deep learning approaches from all students. Biggs' model is student focused, with clear and intentional alignment of assessment, teaching and learning activities, and unit objectives. The focus on the central role of the learner in building meaning is derived from constructivist learning theories, whilst the alignment of assessment, teaching, and learning activities, has its foundation in instructional design literature. 

This section briefly describes these underlying principles, and related literature, each of which is later expanded upon in \cref{cha:guiding_principles}. \sref{sub:approaches_to_learning} describes the work on approaches to learning, and presents Robert and Susan as two caricatures of the deep and surface approaches to learning. The central focus on constructive learning theories is then discussed in \sref{sub:constructivism}, with a discussion of aligned curriculum following in \sref{sub:aligned_curriculum}. The section concludes with an overview of the model of constructive alignment, \sref{sub:the_model_of_constructive_alignment}, and then a brief discussion of the example implementation of these principles that was presented by \citet{Biggs:1996c}.

\subsection{Approaches to Learning} % (fold)
\label{sub:approaches_to_learning}

\citet{Marton:1976a} study on student approaches to learning examined the processes and strategies students applied to learning. The work identified two different levels of processing, described as \emph{surface} and \emph{deep} approaches to learning. When a student adopts a deep approach to learning, they study with the aim of understanding the material. They engage meaningfully with the task at hand, and use high cognitive levels in order to integrate the new knowledge into their current understanding. In contrast, when students use surface approaches to learning they engage lower cognitive levels, and aim only to be able to reproduce the material in test or exam conditions.

text itself, versus the meaning behind the text.

\cite{DeRaadt:2005} approach to learning  had the strongest correlation to success as compared to other cognitive and demographic measures.


In their study of students' experiences learning to program, \citet{Bruce:2003} categorised the way students engage with learning to program into five categories range from approaches focusing on ``\emph{getting through the unit}'', to approaches aimed at discovering what it means to be a programmer. Each of these categories can be broadly classified as either a surface or deep approach to learning \cite{Marton:1976a,Ramsden:1992} to program. When engaging surface approaches, students attempt to address the outcomes with as little effort as possible. This leads to situations in which students are primarily motivated by fear of failing, and experience the learning as a struggle, with the topic appearing tedious, hard and boring, adjectives that are too often associated with learning to program \cite{McGettrick:2005}. On the other hand, when engaging deep approaches to learning students seek meaning in what they do, and relate their learning to the bigger picture. To succeed at learning to program, students need to engage deep approaches to learning, as surface approaches alone are unlikely to be sufficient \cite{Bruce:2003}. Pedagogy that encourage students to adopt deep approaches to learning should, therefore, help address some of the issues related to this challenging topic.

\subsection{Constructivism} % (fold)
\label{sub:constructivism}

Constructivism is a theory of knowledge that focuses on the active role of the learner in constructing their own understanding. Dating back to \citet{Piaget:1950} constructivism exists in several forms: cognitive, individual, post-modern, radical and social constructivism \cite{Phillips:1995,Steffe:1995}. Each of these forms of constructivism has various implications for teaching and learning.



In designing teaching and learning contexts, educators use some form of theory of teaching and learning to guide their decision making.

\subsection{Aligned Curriculum} % (fold)
\label{sub:aligned_curriculum}

The second pillar of constructive alignment is \emph{aligned curriculum}. The impact of aligning teaching and learning activities and assessment tasks was highlighted by \citet{Cohen:1987}. In discussing instructional alignment, \citet{Cohen:1987} reported students received significantly better results when the teaching was aligned to the assessment than with non-aligned instruction. In proposing constructive alignment \citet{Biggs:1996c} aligned teaching and learning activities and assessment tasks to intended learning outcomes, weaving a ``web of consistency'' to optimise the likelihood of students \emph{engaging appropriately} with learning activities \cite{Biggs:1999}.

\subsection{The Model of Constructive Alignment} % (fold)
\label{sub:the_model_of_constructive_alignment}

The model of constructive alignment, as illustrated in \fref{fig:Houghton}, consists of the following blocks \cite{Houghton:2004}:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item \emph{Intended learning outcomes} clearly define required learning in terms of ``performances of understanding''.
	\item \emph{Performance objectives} emerge from the desired outcomes, and can be ranked to become the assessment criteria.
	\item \emph{Teaching and learning activities} are designed to place students in situations likely to elicit the required learning.
	\item Students provide \emph{evidence of their learning}, that is assessed against the criteria to determine grade outcomes.
\end{itemize}

\section{Reported Applications of Constructive Alignment} % (fold)
\label{sec:reported_applications_of_constructive_alignment}

In this section we outline a literature review that examined the applications of constructive alignment in Higher Education. This review aimed to help identify how constructive alignment can be applied to introductory programming, and any gaps in the current research literature. 

\subsection{Review Method} % (fold)
\label{sub:review_method}

\citet{Petticrew:2008} define a structure literature review as a process of systematically analysing all available studies in order to answer specific research questions.This work followed the structured literature review process of \citet{Kitchenham:2004}, and aimed to identify all available studies on how Constructive Alignment has been applied in Higher Education.

\fref{fig:struct_review_proc} shows the three phases in the structured literature review carried out in this work. The first phase identified appropriate search and filter criteria to be used in locating associated literature. In Phase 2, the search criteria is used to identify potentially relevant articles from the indicated sources. The articles identified are then filtered using the filter criteria to identify the relevant articles to pass on to Phase 3, where relevant data is collected from the articles are the analysis performed.

\begin{figure}[tbph]

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{SystematicReview}
	\caption{Processes in the Structured Literature Review process carried out in this work}
	\label{fig:struct_review_proc}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Phase 1: Search and Filter Criteria} % (fold)
\label{sub:review_questions}

This review focused on the application of constructive alignment, and the effectiveness of the teaching and learning environment created. \citet{Petticrew:2008} suggest that the formulation of research questions for a systematic review should consider five aspects: Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome and Context (PICOC). Addressing these five aspects enable effective search and filter criteria, that will then be used to identify related work for the review to analyse.

\tref{tbl:picoc} lists the five PICOC aspects related to this review. The Population consists of the specific target group that the study will examine. In this study, the population included students and academics in the context of Higher Education. This work aimed to review interventions where academics had applied the principles of Constructive Alignment, and any comparisons they had with their existing approaches to teaching and learning. In terms of outcomes, we were interested in examining any positive or negative impacts these changes had on either the staff or the students.

\begin{table}[t]
	\centering
	\caption{Focus for database search using PICOC}
	\label{tbl:picoc}

    \begin{tabular}{|l|p{9cm}|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Population} & Students and Academics in Higher Education\\ \hline
    \textbf{Intervention} & Applications of Constructive Alignment in the design of teaching and learning activities and assessment. \\ \hline
    \textbf{Comparison} & Existing approaches \\ \hline
    \textbf{Outcomes} & Positive and negative impacts on student learning, as well as impacts on teaching staff. \\ \hline
    \textbf{Context} & Application of Constructive Alignment to the design and delivery of teaching and learning material in a Higher Education setting. \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}


This structured literature review aimed to answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item What evidence is there of studies on the application of constructive alignment to teaching and learning in higher education?
	\item How has the effectiveness of constructive alignment been measured in these studies, and how effective has constructive alignment been in the higher education setting?
	\item What teaching and learning activities are used in conjuncture with constructive alignment?
	\item What forms of assessment have been used with constructive alignment?
	\item In what ways have applications of constructive alignment addressed the two main elements of constructive alignment: constructivism and aligned curriculum?
\end{enumerate}

\citet{Petticrew:2008} described the need for the search criteria to result in high number of relevant articles, while excluding irrelevant ones. These are referred to as the search criteria sensitivity and specificity. A search with high sensitivity returns a high number of relevant articles, one with high specificity a low proportion of irrelevant articles. While an ideal search criteria would be both highly sensitive and highly specific, there generally tends to be a trade-off between the two. 

\citet{Kitchenham:2004} provides a number of recommendations on how to define appropriate search criteria, including the use of Boolean AND and OR conditions as well as searching for synonyms. Using this approach results in a search with higher specificity, and can result in a low number of articles being identified, see \citet{Salleh:2011} for example. Therefore, for this work it was decided to start with a highly \emph{sensitive} search criteria, and search for articles that match the term ``Constructive Alignment''. If this resulted in a unacceptably large number of results then more specific criteria could be added.

Given the highly sensitive search criteria, a high number of irrelevant articles was anticipated. To address this, Phase 1 also defined a number of filter conditions. These conditions aimed to clearly define why papers would be excluded from the analysis in Phase 3. The following list shows the criteria used.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item The full text of the paper must be available to the researchers, and must be published in English.
	\item The paper must appear in a peer refereed conference, journal or workshop.
	\item Constructive Alignment must be mentioned, and discussed.
	\item Results must relate to the use of Constructive Alignment in a teaching and learning context.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Phase 2: Identification of Relevant Literature} % (fold)
\label{ssub:identification_of_relevant_literature}

In Phase 2, the search and filter criteria from Phase 1 were used to carry out the search on the selected online databases. The resulting articles were collected in an academic reference management system, that allowed articles to be categorised using a status and a number of tags. Categories were created to indicate why a paper had been excluded, and to mark each paper's progress through the data collection. 

Database searches were performed within the reference management system, which provided facilities to automate the collection of the citation data and the associated full text. Where the full text was not available from the database, a general search was performed using a number of search engines in order to ensure the full text was included for as many articles as possible. This import process also identified any references that were already included in the system, thereby avoiding the creation of duplicates in the resulting library.

The use of the categorisation tools in the academic reference management system allowed the Filter stage of Phase 2 and the Data Collection stage of Phase 3 to run concurrently. Once imported, each article was placed in a \textbf{To Be Categorised} status, thereby providing a backlog of the articles that were to be examined. Each of these articles was then examined using the filter criteria, and moved to a separate status as the filter process progressed. The stages of this process are shown in \fref{fig:filter_proc}.

\begin{figure}[tbph]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{FilterProcess}
	\caption{Filter process applied to papers}
	\label{fig:filter_proc}
\end{figure}

In the first stage of the filter process the availability of full text, the language it was written in, and its refereed status was checked. If these were not met the paper was allocated to the \textbf{Ignore} status, and did not proceed to the next stage of the filter. 

At the next stage a full text search was conducted on each paper. This search looked for the presence of any text related to constructivism or alignment through the search strings ``construct'' and ``align''. The associated text was then read, and the paper was allocated to \textbf{Done (no mention of Constructive Alignment)} when there was no presence of either words, to \textbf{Done (insufficient details on Constructive Alignment)} when it was mentioned briefly with no details or in depth discussion, and to \textbf{To Be Read} in all other cases. All papers that had mentioned Constructive Alignment were tagged at this stage.

Stage 3 involved reading the abstracts, and all sections related to Constructive Alignment from the papers in the To Be Read status. A new status was allocated to each paper: \textbf{Done (not a Teaching and Learning Context)} if they were a discussion of education theory rather than a study of a teaching and learning context, \textbf{Done (not an application of Constructive Alignment)} if they mentioned Constructive Alignment but had not adopted it for the reported work, and \textbf{Get Data} in all other cases.

The final stage involved reading the full text of the papers in the Get Data status, and classifying them based on what Constructive Alignment had been applied to. Data was collected from all of the papers at this stage, but only those related to the delivery of a unit were forwarded to the analysis phase.

\subsubsection{Phase 3: Data Collection and Analysis} % (fold)
\label{ssub:data_collection_and_analysis}

Data collection was performed by reading the indicated papers and looking for the details in the following list. Findings were recorded in a spreadsheet for further analysis, with relevant quotes from the text being stored alongside the summarised information.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Level of Unit: Undergraduate, Postgraduate and/or year level.
	\item The Intended Learning Outcomes and associated levels from the SOLO taxonomy.
	\item Teaching and Learning activities used.
	\item Approach to assessment.
	\item Reported effects of constructive alignment.
\end{itemize}

In keeping with the holistic nature of the assessment approaches suggested in \cite{Biggs:1997}, the quality measure for each paper was generated by response to the following question using a five point Likert scale \cite{Likert:1932}: 5 being strongly agree, 4 agree, 3 neutral, 2 disagree, and 1 strongly disagree.

\begin{quote}
``The paper clearly communicates how constructive alignment was applied to the unit, and the results obtained. ''	
\end{quote}

Once all of the data had been collected the details were summarised in the spreadsheet, and analysed to answer the review questions.

\subsection{Results} % (fold)
\label{sub:review_results}

The search involved the use of seventeen online databases, all of which were searched for the term ``Constructive Alignment''. \tref{tbl:review_source} lists the number of results from each of the selected databases. Google Scholar and CiteSeer resulted in an overly large number of articles for the selected search term. In both cases the results appears to have a large number of irrelevant matches, and so the search terms were updated. The search in Google Scholar was updated to use the term ``intitle:``Constructive Alignment'''', while CiteSeer was limited to searching abstracts for the associated text.

\label{sub:teaching_and_learning_activities}

In the papers that included face-to-face delivery, the data collection examined the types of classes used. The results of this are included in \tref{tbl:class_types}, which lists the number, and percentage, of the papers that reported using lectures, various kinds of tutorials, and other teaching and learning activities. \tref{tbl:class_types} also records the number of papers in which there was no clear communicate of what kind of teaching and learning activities were used.

Lectures and tutorials remain the primary form of class in the papers studied, with 74\% of the papers reporting using either or both of these class types. Four papers included the use of \emph{Other} class types, the details of which appear in the following list. It is interesting to note that five papers, 15\%, did not provide details on the teaching and learning activities used.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item \citet{Szili:2011} reported using a four day field camp to visit the scene of a serious environmental crisis, as part of a unit related to environmental management.
	\item \citet{donnisonre} who included twenty hours of community service, as part of a unit in the first year of an degree in Education.
	\item Eight weeks of clinical practice \citet{Tang:1999}, as part of a nursing degree.
	\item \citet{Shoufan:2010:CRP:1789934.1789937} included an excursion of a fabrication plant as part of an electronics and digital systems design unit. %, though this activity was not realted to the unit's outcomes.

When collecting data on the class types used, additional information was sought as to how constructive learning theories had been incorporated into the teaching and learning activities. Three different strategies were identified: applying concepts through the use of \textbf{problem-based learning} or the examination of case studies, making the classes more \textbf{interactive}, and \textbf{group work} and discussions. 

Problem-based Learning, projects, and case studies, provide a means for educators to create a setting in which students can develop knowledge through application of associated principles. The constructivist nature of these activities has been reported by a range of authors, see for example \citet{Hendry:1999,Savery:1995} and \citet{Schmidt:2009}. In the articles analysed in this research, examples of this approach include the use of Problem-based Learning by \citet{warren2005teaching} in teaching software design. Programming projects played an important part of the work reported by \citet{Brabrand:2008}, these provided an opportunity for students to apply their understanding of concurrency in a practical sense.

\citet{Davey:2002} reported that in their unit on pharmacokinetics, lectures were changed to examine case studies that guided student decision making in relation to drug therapy and to explore scientific rationale. 

Interactive lectures and classes indicate a shift away from the objectivist ideas of knowledge transfer, and toward constructivist ideals. \citet{shepherd2005weaving} provides one example of this where lectures shifted to ``lectures as workshops'', with case studies being discussed and the lecturer solving problems from first principles.

\citet{Palincsar:1998} indicated that from a social constructivist perspective, higher-order thinking can be enhanced through the use of social interaction, such as can be achieved through classroom discussion. A number of papers indicated a shift to group work and classroom discussions as a means of engaging with these constructivist theories. One example of this shift is reported by \citet{Israel:2007}, who reported using tutorials as a means of guiding group research projects in their advanced undergraduate unit on psychology.

\tref{tbl:class_constructive} shows counts of the number of papers that reported the use of each of these different strategies for incorporating constructive learning theories in the teaching and learning activities. Again, it is interesting to note that twelve papers, 35\%, did not discuss the use of any strategy for addressing constructivism in their teaching and learning activities.

The remaining four online units used the following teaching and learning activities.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item \citet{hoddinott2000biggs} students were provided with reading, optional reading, and a range of online resources.
	\item \citet{raeburn2009blended} included work-based learning, and the use of online reflective journals.
	\item \citet{terrell2011using} provided online tutorials.
	\item \citet{brown2006looking} used online ``Thought conferences'' where questions were designed to promote interaction through involving case studies and problem-based inquiry.

\label{sub:review_assessment_approach}

Approach to student assessment included a range of activities, as shown in \tref{tbl:assessment_types}. Each of the different assessment approaches is detailed in the following list. It is interesting to note that assignments and exams remain the most frequently used approach to assessment.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item \textbf{Examination}: the work indicated the use of a final exam.
	\item \textbf{Assignments}: included classwork assignments, projects, essays, and other work conducted by students individually during the teaching period.
	\item \textbf{Group Projects and Assignments}: indicate the use of group marks in the student grades, and included group assignments, presentations and projects.
	\item \textbf{Reflective Journals}: consisted of journals to reflect on the learning process.
	\item \textbf{Tests during delivery}: indicates the use of tests commonly referred to as ``mid-term'' tests or quizzes.
	\item \textbf{Portfolios}: include a range of assessment approaches, discussed below, involving the collection of a number of pieces of work that are submitted as a group.
	\item \textbf{Participation}: indicates a part of the students grade was awarded for participation in teaching and learning activities.
\end{itemize}

Four papers indicated the use of portfolios in the student assessment but, unlike other forms of assessment, the exact nature of the portfolios differed between the various papers. It is interesting to note that the alignment between the portfolio and the unit's intended learning outcomes is not clearly presented in any of these four papers.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item \citet{Tang:1999} reported the use of a portfolio consisting of a learning diary, case study of a patient from clinical practice, and a piece of the students own choosing. This formed a part of the overall assessment along with an exam.
	\item \citet{raeburn2009blended} indicated the use of two portfolios, each of which included a resume, number of blog entries, and written report of experience in work based learning. In this context the portfolio is little more that a means of collecting together these separate tasks.
	\item Portfolios reported by \citet{scott2009promoting} required students to complete twelve tasks over the course of the year, and combine these for submission as their portfolio. The assessment of the portfolio was looking for positive contributions, but little details was provided as to how this assessment was performed.
	\item ePortfolios were used in conjuncture with other assignments in the work reported by \citet{donnisonre}. The ePortfolios included a multimedia digital story on their communities, and to document their community service.

\subsubsection{Aligning Curriculum and Assessment} % (fold)
\label{sub:aligning_curriculum}

All of the papers included some details on alignment. In most cases the papers presented generic details of the importance of achieving alignment between teaching and learning activities and assessment tasks, with fewer then providing any details on how this alignment was performed. As indicated in \tref{tbl:alignment_details}, 61\% of the papers analysed provided little, or no, explicit details on how the alignment was achieved. In many of these papers the teaching and learning activities were discussed in some detail, but the specifics of how these were intended to develop students understanding of the intended learning outcomes was not discussed.

\begin{table}[p]

\end{figure}

Where there was an explanation of the alignment, the teaching and learning activities and assessment tasks were often presented in a matrix, or graphic, that showed the intended learning outcomes and the associated teaching and learning activities and assessment tasks. \tref{tbl:example_matrix} shows an example of how one of the intended learning outcomes was presented in \citet{terrell2011using}. Other papers included textual descriptions of how the alignment was performed, for example \citet{Brabrand:2008} provided an in depth discussion of how they planned the alignment for their unit on concurrency. The numbers of papers that explained alignment using a matrix, or other graphical means, or textually is shown in \tref{tbl:alignment_details} and graphically in \fref{fig:alignment_explain}.

Thirty five of the thirty eight papers indicated that alignment was performed by staff. The remaining three papers included the use of portfolios where students were required to include evidence that aligned to the unit's intended learning outcomes. The relevant details from these three papers are described in the following list.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item \citet{hoddinott2000biggs} described a unit on Biology where students were required to align their portfolio submissions with the intended learning outcomes and assessment criteria. Unfortunately insufficient details were provided to enable deeper understanding of how this was subsequently assessed.
	\item Portfolios were also used in the unit described by \citet{scott2009promoting}, though little explicit details were provided about how alignment was achieved. 
	\item \citet{Tang:1999} provided a third example of portfolio assessment, but in this case the portfolio's objectives were not directly linked to unit intended learning outcomes.

\subsubsection{Method for Evaluating Results} % (fold)

The analysed papers indicated the use of one, or more, of a number of different data sources as a basis for their evaluation of the teaching and learning environment created. \tref{tbl:eval_source} lists the number of papers that included a single and multiple evaluation sources, and the number that did not include any evaluation.

Evaluations sources used in this work are listed in \tref{tbl:eval_kind}, with each of the sources being described in the following list. 

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item \textbf{Student Feedback}: typically included feedback received as part of official unit evaluation questionnaires, but also included comments related to assessment tasks, and other informal sources of student feedback.
	\item \textbf{Results}: indicated the use of unit grades, or results from individual assessment tasks.
	\item \textbf{Student Work}: included document analysis of student assessment work, including assignments, examinations and portfolios.
	\item \textbf{Interviews and Focus Groups}: additional feedback was received in response to focus groups or interviews in eight of the papers analysed.

\subsubsection{Effects of Constructive Alignment} % (fold)
\label{sub:effects_of_constructive_alignment}

\tref{tbl:paper_results} lists the number of papers that indicated some positive results, or issues, in relation to the unit delivered. Of the thirty eight papers analysed, four did not include any evaluation of the delivery of the unit as noted in the previous section. Of the thirty four papers that included some results, 97\% indicated positive aspects and 21\% indicated issues.

\begin{table}[p]
	\centering
	\caption{Number of papers reporting positive results, and issues, related to the teaching and learning environment created.}
	\label{tbl:paper_results}
	\footnotesize
    \begin{tabular}{l|c|l}
     \textbf{Results} & \textbf{Count} & \textbf{Percent} \\ \hline
		No Evaluation & 	4 &	11\% of papers analysed \\

		- Some Positive Results	 & 33 &	97\% of papers with results \\
		- Some Issues & 	7 &	21\% of papers with results  \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In relation to positive results, there were three common themes: positive learning outcomes, student satisfaction and student engagement. The number of papers reporting each of these is shown in \tref{tbl:pos_results}, papers that reported other positive results are also included. The following list outlines the papers that reported other positive aspects.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item \citet{Hill:2009} reported benefits related to the ongoing refinement of the intended learning outcomes, and learning environment in general. The work also indicated that staff found the formative feedback was easier to deliver and stimulated wider discussion in class.
	\item \citet{Morton:2008} identified positive aspects realted to improvements in written communication and understanding of the rigour required in laboratory work.
	\item Improvements in student confidence was reported by \citet{scott2009promoting}, along with their analysis of portfolios showing students had very deep and meaningful learning experiences.
	\item \citet{Schaefer:2009} reported that the use of real world problems, as compared to text book learning, had helped better prepare students for careers in mechanical engineering.
	\item \citet{Vanfretti:2011} indicated the use of free and open source software had helped to engage students in deep approaches to learning.
	\item Results reported by \citet{Vogel:2007} indicated some positive effects for students using constructively aligned learning support over those who had chosen not to use these options. 
\end{itemize}

Positive learning outcomes were reported in the form of higher pass rates, higher percentage of students passing on the first attempt, or as demonstrations of high quality student learning outcomes. \citet{Szili:2011}, for example, indicated that student learning journals had exceeded staff expectations, with student work showing capacity to evaluate information, learning to reason and construct arguments, engagement with and learning from the wider world, and other positive learning outcomes. Other examples include the work of \citet{warren2005teaching}, where students who sat the exam demonstrated the ability to apply material covered to solve new problems.

High student satisfaction was also reported in a number of papers, and typically refer to unit evaluation surveys.  \citet{shepherd2005weaving}, for example, indicated that students regarded their learning experience in the associated unit as uniquely, or unusually, satisfying. The work also indicated that students do not enjoy rote memorisation but often feel it is required or the only possible approach in some units. Similarly, \citet{scott2009promoting} reported very high satisfaction rates, with overall feedback being very positive. Students identified the interactive lecture approach and online resources as hugely beneficial.

Student engagement was also reported as a positive result in a number of papers. \citet{Davey:2002} reported a significant shift with students being more interested in their learning experiences and how the unit encouraged these. The work noted that students' comments shifted away from concerns assessment requirements to interest in what they were learning. Survey results indicated student interest in the subject matter, enjoyment of learning, and challenge and motivation to learn were significantly different after the reported initiative. Another good example of student engagement was reported by \citet{Szili:2011}, whose work showed students had a strong motivation for active participation in study and learning. Szili and Sobels cited their most important insight as the way that constructive alignment had worked seamlessly to deliver students who were motivated to pursue lifelong learning and engagement with their communities.

	\caption{Number of papers that reported different kinds of positive results, with percentage based on number of papers reporting some positive results.}

     \textbf{Positive Result Related To} & \textbf{Count} & \textbf{Percent} \\ \hline
	Learning outcomes (grades, or otherwise)	 & 19 &	58\% \\
	Student satisfaction	 & 17 &	52\% \\
	Student engagement & 	9 &	27\% \\
	Other positive aspects & 	6 &	18\% \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Issues were reported by fewer papers, with only seven papers reporting issues related to the teaching and learning environment created in the report work. The one common issue was additional staff and student workload as a result of the initiatives, as shown in \tref{tbl:neg_results}. Staff workload related to the development of new material, and the provision of feedback. Student workload issues were reported via the student satisfaction surveys. The remaining two issues, classified as other in the table, are detailed in the following list.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item \citet{Lin:2004} indicated that the less capable students may have found the problem based learning approach used too complex and challenging.
	\item \cite{Tang:1999} reported students not enjoying the portfolio process, and not seeing it as contributing to their learning in the unit. This was attributed to either lack of clear instruction and support throughout the process, or to students prior expectations of assessment.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discussion} % (fold)
\label{sub:discussion}


\subsubsection{Papers Identified} % (fold)
\label{ssub:geographic_location}

The use of a highly selective search criteria identified a wide range of papers, that were subsequently filtered to identify the papers analysed in this work. While every care was taken in filtering these papers, the process was conducted by one person and it is possible that a small number of papers were inappropriately excluded. To help mitigate this risk, the papers excluded at each stage were examined at least twice before filtering proceeded to the next stage. At the end of the process we have reasonable confidence in the papers included in this analysis, but future work will apply the same process using multiple reviewers with the aim of producing a more definitive review of applications of constructive alignment. 

It is interesting to note the number of papers that were excluded as a result of insufficient discussion on constructive alignment. Many of these papers included some details of constructive alignment in the introduction and background, and again in the conclusions, but provided no discussion in the body of the work. For example, \citet{Penaluna:EducationTraining:2009} indicated opportunities for constructive alignment in the implications of their research on assessment strategies for entrepreneurship education, but provide little details on either constructivism or alignment in the remainder of the paper. One possible explanation for this is the growing expectation that work in education should include the principles of constructive alignment. This message is, for example, clearly communicated in the work of \citet{Haigh:2012} on successfully writing for the Journal of Geography in Higher Education. Given the large number of papers in this category it would be interesting to examine them in more detail to see how they do relate to constructive alignment. 

The papers identified provided a reasonable sample of work across a number of fields of study, but is predominantly related to undergraduate education. A greater balance between undergraduate and postgraduate had been expected, so it would be interesting to find out why constructive alignment has not been discussed more in relation to postgraduate education.

Examining the geographic location of the work resulted in a couple of interesting observations. Firstly the high number of papers from Australiasia, and the relatively small number from Northern America. The high number of papers from Australiasia may be a result of the choice of databases, with three of the databases containing work predominantly from Australia and New Zealand. However, the largest number of papers were located from databases with broad focuses so this may indicate a greater focus on education research in this region, and a wide adoption of the principles of constructive alignment. The reverse could therefore also be posed in relation to the relatively small number of papers from Northern America. This could indicate that constructive alignment has not gained as wide a popularity in that region, or that relatively little research is published on the application of principles in Education. Both cases provide interesting questions for future research.

% subsubsection geographic_location (end)

\subsubsection{Effective Evaluation Sources} % (fold)
\label{ssub:effective_evaluation_sources}

A clear message from the analysed papers was the value of using multiple data sources in evaluating outcomes. Student satisfaction surveys and unit results appear to be readily available sources of information, and provide valuable evidence of learning outcomes and student perceptions. This can then be further enhanced by analysis of student work and staff reflections.

One topic not often discussed in the papers analysed is the ethical implications of using student work for purposes other than assessing the students learning. Issues related to the power imbalance of the student-teaching relationship, and issues associated with the perception of coercion will need to be addressed. If student work is to be used then an appropriate ethical protocol will need to be developed, and students given the opportunity to give informed consent for their participation in the research.

% subsubsection effective_evaluation_sources (end)

\subsubsection{Opportunities for Misalignment} % (fold)
\label{ssub:opportinities_for_misalignment}

There appears to be significant opportunities for misalignment due to the lack of student engagement with the alignment process. Many of the papers analysed used a traditional assessment strategy involving the use of one, or more, assignments and a final exam. In this situation the teaching staff are entirely responsible for ensuring alignment between the unit's intended learning outcomes and the outcomes assessed in student submissions. 

\fref{fig:misalignment} tries to capture the situation where staff perform the alignment, for the purpose of illustrating areas for potential misalignment. Staff use intended learning outcomes in the design of assessment tasks for the students to perform. These tasks may aim to elicit outcomes that require high level cognitive activities such as explaining or reflecting on the application of some principles. Staff intentions must then be communicated to students via the assessment tasks, a complex activity that can be unintentionally undermined in a variety of ways. Even if the intentions can be captured perfectly, student interpretations of these expectations are likely to weaken any requirements. As indicated in \sref{sub:approaches_to_learning}, a number of students will aim to perform assessment tasks with as little effort as possible. These students will employ surface level approaches to learning where possible, and fail to engage the high level cognitive activities expected. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Misalignment}
	\caption{When using a traditional assignment and exam assessment strategy, particular attention needs to be paid to ensure Staff intentions carry through to student actions.}
	\label{fig:misalignment}
\end{figure}

In addition to misalignment in the design of the assessment tasks there is also opportunities for misalignment on the assessment side of the process. Assessment tasks require assessment criteria that indicate how marks are awarded for the various aspects of the task. Where this is carried out quantitatively there is significant potential for misalignment, with the contents of knowledge needing to be broken down into identifiable units. As indicated by \citet{Biggs:1996c} this results in situations where assessment encourages piecemeal identification of details, and provides no encouragement for combining these details into a coherent whole.

Given the majority use of assignments and exams and this potential for misalignment, it is particularly concerning how few papers provided any in depth discussion on how the alignment was performed. Where details of the alignment was provided, the papers indicated how staff aligned topics in the intended learning outcomes with the tasks in the assignments and the questions in the exams but few papers provided any reflections on the approaches that students had engaged, and how well these aligned with staff intentions. It should be mentioned that two of the papers analysed did provide good details on this aspect. \citet{Brabrand:2008} provided a very detailed discussion of how tasks had been aligned to outcomes, and yet still indicated that their work was not an ideal example of alignment in recognition of these challenges. \citet{Hill:2009} provided significant details on the challenges, and iterative improvements, with aligning student activity to outcomes and staff intentions with the delivery of their unit over a six years period. 

These challenges indicate that any genuine attempt to implement the principles of constructive alignment will need to be performed over a number of iterations. Each iteration should aim to improve alignment based on evidence gathered, and reflected upon, as part of unit delivery.

\subsubsection{Business as Usual} % (fold)
\label{ssub:business_as_usual}

In proposing Constructive Alignment, \citet{Biggs:1996c} describes a teaching and learning environment which is student centred. Biggs argued for the use of a range of teaching and learning activities, and encouraged active student engagement. With assessment, Biggs argued against examinations, short answer and multiple-choice questions. Indicating that these approaches to assessment are likely to give credit to lower level performances than intended, and thereby encourage students to adopt lower cognitive levels than desired. \citet{Biggs:1996c} strongly implied the use of portfolios, which was further elaborated upon in \citet{Biggs:1997}. Portfolio assessment in this context had referred to a body of work demonstrating how the student had met the intended learning outcomes, with a justification for how the selected pieces related to the unit objectives. The principles of Constructive Alignment had been discovered by Biggs as a result of the environment created through this clear focus on the intended learning outcomes, and the ``web of consistency'' that had resulted.

The clarity and vision provided by \citet{Biggs:1996c} does not appear to have resulted in many changes in the reported work. In many ways the papers analysed indicated a ``business as usual'' approach. Constructive Alignment involved staff thinking about how their lectures, and the tasks they asked students to perform, related to the unit's intended learning outcomes. Some of the ideas of constructivism have made their way into teaching as either group work, and its associated group assessment, or attempts to make lectures and other classes more interactive. Similarly, approaches to assessment have remained primarily unchanged from the standard assignments and final exam. The ideas of learning through mistakes, and centring activities on students appears to have received little attention. Portfolios, when used, did not follow the principles of Constructive Alignment, or had little details on how they had been implemented. 

While the approaches taken can be argued to be applications of ``Constructive Alignment'', they do not appear to have captured the dramatic shift in thinking that is reported by \citet{Biggs:1996c}. The student centred approach of the portfolios, with alignment to intended learning outcomes at their heart, does not appear to have gone beyond the original work. If the papers analysed are representative of ``Constructive Alignment'', then perhaps the work reported by Biggs goes beyond basic the core principles to capture additional aspects that are beneficial to student learning. Rediscovering these principles and trying to recreate the ``web of consistency'' is a worthwhile pursuit, and a goal of this research.
