	abstract = {Abstract Teaching larger software engineering project courses at the end of a computing curriculum is a way for students to learn some aspects of real-world jobs in industry. Such courses, often referred to as capstone courses, are effective for learning how to apply the skills they have acquired in, for example, design, test, and configuration management. However, these courses are typically performed in small teams, giving only a limited realistic perspective of problems faced when working in real companies. This paper describes an alternative approach to classic capstone projects, with the aim of being more realistic from an organizational, process, and communication perspective. This methodology, called the company approach, is described by intended learning outcomes, teaching/learning activities, and assessment tasks. The approach is implemented and evaluated in a larger Master's student course.}

	abstract = {Changes in the nature of pharmacy education are often discussed in terms of differences in teaching method rather than a concern for student learning. A case study of a clinical pharmacokinetics course (CPKC) illustrates some issues. In 2000, the course was reviewed against a backdrop of research on teaching and learning. It showed that students' experiences tended to be reproductive, focusing on the acquisition of more knowledge, especially for examination purposes. In 2001, changes were made, emphasising a constructive alignment of all aspects of the curriculum, aimed at encouraging, understanding, and the development of critical thinking skills. Subsequent review showed a significant shift: students were more interested in their learning experiences and how the course encouraged these. The case study illustrates how small curriculum changes can make a significant differences to students' experiences of learning pharmacokinetics if the changes are made at a philosophical and strategic level rather than focusing on teaching methods.

	abstract = {In contemporary South Africa issues of class, race and language intersect with issues around schooling and complicate access to tertiary education. This article is an enquiry-based reflection on the challenges of providing epistemological access to an entry-level English course for students enrolling for a Bachelor of Education. As English specialists, we grapple with how to teach a powerful global language in a multilingual context in ways that are sensitive to the identities of our diverse student body. The course under analysis seeks to address this by recruiting students' diverse (linguistic) identities as a resource and placing them at the centre of the curriculum. We begin by discussing the politics of knowledge selection, the interplay between curriculum and identity (Cummins, 2000, 2003) and various other pedagogic strategies, such as Vygotskian ideas of mediation and scaffolding. Central to our analysis is Biggs's notion of constructive alignment (1996, 2003). In our post-course reflection, we work dialectically with this notion, using it to identify tensions and inconsistencies in our practice while at the same time using our practice to critique and extend this notion. Ultimately we propose a more nuanced, multidimensional model of alignment that we believe would be better suited for courses concerned with issues of access, power and diversity.}

	abstract = {Alternative pathways and enabling courses such as foundation programmes are well-established in some tertiary institutions and are likely to be broadened and enhanced across the sector. If such a course is designed along the lines of Biggs constructive alignment, it would be hoped that students would be likely to adopt a deep approach to learning through their course of study. In addition, it is often assumed (but rarely properly demonstrated) that such courses promote the confidence of students to achieve well in their academic studies. This study explored changes in approaches to learning and academic self-efficacy in the first topic of a Foundation Course, using Biggs R-SPQ-2F and a newly developed academic self-efficacy scale. While the findings on approaches to learning were inconclusive, analysis showed a substantial and statistically significant increase in academic self-efficacy.}

	abstract = {Learners who 'strategically' engage with information systems and computing curricula are becoming more prevalent in Higher Education institutions. Increasingly they demand more prescriptive advice from teaching staff to achieve particular grades and often fail to demonstrate the learning outcomes that the curriculum originally intended to deliver. The use of Biggs' Constructive Alignment [1] to revise the curriculum has presented new opportunities to reflect upon the learning activities that need to be undertaken, and can result in a focus on teaching process rather than how to achieve a product. This paper presents a case study of how a business process modelling module has been developed over six years to progressively align the assessment tasks with learning activities and Intended Learning Outcomes (ILO). Early indications were that the explicit declaration of ILO made the learners appear more strategic. This shift provided new challenges for the teaching staff, particularly in terms of designing appropriate summative assessment, and presenting the ILO to learners in a meaningful and justifiable way. The use of form templates is described to assist the communication of ILO, as well as supporting the thinking necessary to build a constructively aligned curriculum. Such a curriculum places more emphasis upon the dynamics of learning interactions, and should explore what learners achieve outside of the timetabled curriculum. Finally, this work is evaluated in the context of qualitative responses to open questions asked at the end of each iteration of the module. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

	abstract = {This paper describes the collaboration between Sheffield Hallam University and an International IT Consulting organisation to develop an innovative postgraduate curriculum that combines intensive, vendor-specific certification training together with a challenging enquiry-focused educational experience. Employers prefer to 'benchmark' potential applicants against industry certification standards, yet also desire the qualities of a postgraduate's enquiring mind. Using research and 'open enquiry' as principle values, a curriculum has been created that facilitates exploration of a wide range of practical and theoretical topics in order to support the development of a highly skilled, autonomous 'Technical Consultant'. A key aspect of this approach is to provide guidance for learners to explore their own development paths, whilst also exposing them to an established vendor specific platform in order to gain sufficient practical experience before seeking employment.

	abstract = {It is becoming increasingly important that university students, especially those intending to study at postgraduate level, develop the ability to engage critically with the material presented to them and to translate that material into real-world contexts (Candy, 2000; Spronken-Smith, 2005). It has been argued that providing the elements for facilitating deep learning through collaborative and problem-based techniques, as well as aligning course outcomes, teaching processes, and assessment, ensures a synthesis between the course design and lecturers' expectations of students (Barraket, 2004; Biggs, 1996). This short report will briefly examine our attempt to enact deep learning, problem-based learning, and constructive alignment principles in the project and tutorial tasks of an advanced psychology research design undergraduate module (RDA IIB). Both the practical steps taken to implement these principles and their evaluation will be discussed, as well as implications for future practice. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

Comparisons were made with newly qualified nurses who did not participate in a constructively aligned curriculum.This mixed methods study reported skill identification within the immediate post-registration period and evaluated the constructively aligned curriculum as having positive benefits for NQNs in terms of confidence to practice. This was supported by preceptors views.The study recommends two process models for nursing skills curriculum development and reports that constructive alignment is a useful theoretical framework for nurse educators.}

Integrated technology supports were deployed to increase the consistency between learning objectives, activities and assessment and to foster student-centred, higher-order learning processes in the unit. Modifications took place over nine iterations of a second-year Marketing unit and were guided by a design-based research approach. The aligned technologies were embedded in voluntary weekly tasks, feedback, lecture participation and research skill acquisition. Findings indicate that constructive alignment strengthens and is strengthened by technology supports, resulting in consistently improved learner experiences in small (under 60) and large (over 500) face-to-face cohorts, over time and in comparison to benchmark data derived from over 65 similar units. Heuristic themes emerging from the study conceive constructively aligned technology interventions as gateways, springboards and enablers to improved learning and learner experiences.}

Based on the principles of constructive alignment, this research considers whether student perception of learning achievement measures can be used to gain insights into how course activities and pedagogy are assisting or hindering students in accomplishing course learning goals. Students in a Marketing Principles course were asked to complete a voluntary survey rating their own progress on the intended learning goals for the course. Student perceptions of learning achievement were correlated with actual student learning, as measured by grade, suggesting that student perceptions of learning achievement measures are suitable for higher educators. Student perception of learning achievement measures provide an alternate means to understand whether students are learning what was intended, which is particularly useful for educators faced with large classes and associated restrictions on assessment. Further, these measures enable educators to simultaneously gather evidence to document the impact of teaching innovations on student learning. Further implications for faculty and future research are offered. (Contains 4 tables.)

Using an undergraduate occupational therapy programme as the site for exploration, this article reports on an application of constructive alignment principles and describes how available empirical data were used to explore student outcomes. A comparison was made between student evaluations and academic grades prior to, and after the implementation of the initiative. Results provide evidence of improvement in student satisfaction and academic grades as a result of implementing constructive alignment.

	abstract = {This paper explores the learning design process a practitioner underwent when tasked with re-designing the curriculum for a fully online programme of study for a campus-based UK university. The process entailed constructive alignment, which is implemented by using the stated learning outcomes as a mechanism to check that the expected learning is likely to take place. The use of learning and teaching taxonomies and the mapping of pedagogy with appropriate technologies aims at avoiding a pitfall of producing e-learning design that mirrors existing practice. Using this approach it has also been possible to identify learning outcomes that have not been addressed within the current online provision. This has allowed the creation of robust pedagogically sound innovative generic activity sequences to be created at the appropriate meta-cognitive level. Furthermore these sequences tap into a variety of learning theories including, social constructivism and situated learning. The paper proposes that such an approach yields numerous advantages to institutions and practitioners (and ultimately the learners) that are tasked with curriculum re-design including re-use of design models and processes, resource planning and the identification of roles in complex professional subjects. These advantages will be discussed as will the issues relating to their implementation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

Helping students to concentrate on assessment criteria paradoxically means that they may take a strategic approach and end up focusing on the superficial aspects of their assessment tasks, rather than engaging in meaningful learning activity. One solution might be to re-conceptualize assessment criteria as 'learning criteria' using Biggs' principle of constructive alignment in curriculum development and delivery. To illustrate how this can work in practice, a case study is presented detailing the development of a counselling psychology module over several years to progressively incorporate a text-based adaptation of the problem-based learning approach. Student evaluations of the approach are presented together with some examples of feedback given on students' work to demonstrate the effects on students' understanding and functioning knowledge}

	abstract = {Abstract Entrepreneurship is a novel course in the curriculum for students in the Information Technology (IT) degree program at La Trobe University, Bundoora, Australia. In comparison to other IT-related courses, the Entrepreneurship course seeks to develop business management knowledge and skills; its learning design is thus different to that of other courses in the IT program. The concept of constructive alignment for curriculum renewal suggests that there are several components of good course design. In this paper, we use the principles of constructive alignment to analyze and redesign several components of the Entrepreneurship course. The focus is on reviewing and aligning the assessment tasks to ensure an effective evaluation and the achievement of student learning outcomes. Since assessment drives student learning, we describe the innovative assessment tasks that were implemented to enhance student learning, provide the rationale for the design of these tasks as supported by the current literature, and reflect on possible future improvements. The course redesign process and the constructive alignment and innovative assessment can be applied to other courses in the field, and more broadly to curriculum, teaching, and learning in higher education.}

Some research projects have constructed the learning activity frame and template for learning activities design, but few research has been found have validity for learning activities design, also the essentiality of ICT for supporting learning activity. The purpose of this study was to set up outcome model for learning activities so as to realize the validity of learning activity design, and indicate the indispensability of ICT in learning activity design. As the basic theory of this study, outcome-based teaching and learning (OBTL) is an approach where teaching and learning activities are developed to support learning outcomes. Based on OBTL, This study extends the meaning of constructive alignment, the core conception of OBTL. Three typical cases were designed using constructive alignment method to achieve the validity of learning activity. The study found that the alignment of learning activities had the essential validity, and the alignment of learning activities showed in two aspects, the alignment between each learning activities, and the alignment among different elements of learning activities, such as learning resource, learning tool and task , etc. ICT plays an important role in the above aspects, especially in the assessment tasks and resource tools. ICT and multi-approach assessments can ensure the implementation of different kinds of learning activity outcomes, and resources made in ICT can also facilitate the achievement of outcomes. What's more, this study also developed the existing evaluation scale for learning activity according to the elements analysis of learning activity. Based on the study results, this research constructed the outcome model for learning activities design in ICT environment. It is expected that the results of this- study could be valuable for learning activities design in higher educational institutions for their Web-based instruction.}

	abstract = {As the learner climbs the ladder of formal education, the role of the teacher transforms from the primary provider of knowledge to that of a mentor. At the university, the learner enters the realm of self-learning, which is synonymous with 'research' in a broad sense. Traditionally, attainment of research capability is measured by the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph D). This measure goes with the assumptions that the person with a Ph D has documented a cognizable and worthwhile doctrine and that the person has contributed to construction of new knowledge. The literature on research theory and practice indicates that any course work on research methods is often either difficult or uninteresting to learners. This may be (i) because the subjects that constitute research methods have not been aligned with the research themes chosen by learners and/or (ii) because the learners have not been appropriately grounded in the philosophical theory that explains the contextual basis for valid research methods. Addressing these gaps, I have argued for the use of the pedagogical tool of 'constructive alignment', integrating philosophical concepts with the themes chosen by the learners for their research activity. I have demonstrated the argued point with the curriculum design of the subject 'Research philosophies and methods', a prerequisite for senior undergraduate learners enrolled in the natural resource management and agribusiness Honours programmes at Charles Sturt University, Orange, Australia.

In this paper, we describe how a patent on a rotary diesel engine, which had failed to work in practice, was used to link undergraduate research and teaching activities by orchestrating two design courses around this patent. Learning outcomes, course goals, content as well as assignments and projects were defined based on constructive alignment. Students' performance was assessed using so-called assessment rubrics, based on Bloom's taxonomy, which were specifically developed for both courses. After introducing the educational framework for this approach to enhancing student learning, we explain how both courses were designed and delivered in order to meet the higher-level educational outcomes envisaged. The paper closes with an overview of both our experiences and those of our students.}

The revised assessment method took the form of a portfolio. Design/methodology/approach  During 2004, all six credit modules at the University of Teesside had to be reviewed and restructured into ten credit modules. Following Biggs' principles of constructive alignment, the tutors looked at the existing module aims and learning outcomes. A review of the literature and previous experience informed the selection of the new assessment method by portfolio. An evaluation of the assessment method was undertaken after the module had run. Findings  The paper finds that the assessment method had real strengths especially in terms of validity. It was also economical and efficient. Students knew what they were expected to do and where they needed to put in effort. Research limitations/implications  The assessment by a portfolio method has been carried out once with a relatively small cohort of students, so the findings can only be regarded as interim. Practical implications  The tutors believe that they have created a very useful module with an aligned assessment method which would be of benefit to a much greater number of students Originality/value  There is a shortage of publications that report the results of the use of portfolios for the assessment of information literacy.}

To foster the development of such tools and skill sets, there has been an increasing trend amongst teaching practitioners to move from objectivist to constructivist views of learning and teaching. Using the theoretical heritage of constructivism, we in this paper offer an example of the effectiveness of constructive alignment in teaching tools and assessment methods for first year Environmental Management students. Drawing inspiration from the successes reported by Biggs et al. (2010) and Park (2003), we offer further discussion on the merits of such approaches, but from a first-year undergraduate cohort.

	abstract = {Social work is a practising profession and when students undergo a social work undergraduate course they are expected to learn and apply the knowledge, skills and values necessary for their future social work career. As an educator, the challenge exists in determining whether students have learnt the material and are prepared to implement the knowledge, skills and values into practice. Current theories on teaching and learning are useful tools to educators who want to ensure that course units are maximizing students' learning potential. This paper focuses on the application of three established teaching and learning theories implemented in a social work module. The paper begins with an overview of Biggs' theory of Constructive Alignment, Biggs' four levels of understanding/Bloom's Taxonomy, and Race's five factors that underpin successful learning. The paper describes the integration of the theories to a social work undergraduate module through the following four-step process: (1) revisit learning outcome...}

	abstract = {The importance of graduate attributes is increasingly recognized internationally in higher education and by industry, government, and accrediting bodies. However, integrating the development of graduate attributes, such as critical thinking and critical reflection, has proved challenging in business education. This article demonstrates the value of constructive alignment for integrating graduate attributes into an intensive marketing course. This illustrative Australian study traces the integration of two graduate attributes from course design, through active student engagement in a range of learning activities, to various assessments of student learning outcomes using standards-based assessment criteria. The study recommends that graduate attributes are expressed as learning outcomes and aligned with assessment criteria, that students' awareness of graduate attributes and their value is developed, that relevance for students' future marketing careers is embedded into learning activities, that substantial opportunities for practice in developing generic skills is offered, that formal and informal feedback from lecturers and peers is provided, and that a programwide approach to developing and integrating graduate attributes is adopted. Finally, the implications for enhancing employability skills of new business professionals and for institutions meeting the assurance of learning standards required for business school accreditation by bodies such as Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, European Quality Improvement System, and Community of European Management Schools and International Companies are considered.

A multi-method model with a combination of qualitative and quantitative design was adopted, using document analysis, interviews and survey. The analysis of covariance results suggested that regardless of individual differences, students would adjust their learning approaches and study behaviours in response to the classroom teaching and learning environment. Students in more constructively aligned courses were more likely to adopt deep learning approaches and less likely to use surface learning approaches in their study of a particular course.},

	abstract = {Two lines of thinking are becoming increasingly important in higher educational practice. The first derives from constructivist learning theory, and the second from the instructional design literature. Constructivism comprises a family of theories but all have in common the centrality of the learner's activities in creating meaning. These and related ideas have important implications for teaching and assessment. Instructional designers for their part have emphasised alignment between the objectives of a course or unit and the targets for assessing student performance.  Constructive alignment  represents a marriage of the two thrusts, constructivism being used as a framework to guide decision-making at all stages in instructional design: in deriving curriculum objectives in terms of performances that represent a suitably high cognitive level, in deciding teaching/learning activities judged to elicit those performances, and to assess and summatively report student performance. The  performances of understanding  nominated in the objectives are thus used to systematically align the teaching methods and the assessment. The process is illustrated with reference to a professional development unit in educational psychology for teachers, but the model may be generalized to most units or programs in higher education.},

	abstract = {Thematic analysis is a poorly demarcated, rarely acknowledged, yet widely used qualitative analytic method within psychology. In this paper, we argue that it offers an accessible and theoretically flexible approach to analysing qualitative data. We outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or patterns, and in relation to different epistemological and ontological positions. We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis. We conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond psychology.}

A multi-method model with a combination of qualitative and quantitative design was adopted, using document analysis, interviews and survey. The analysis of covariance results suggested that regardless of individual differences, students would adjust their learning approaches and study behaviours in response to the classroom teaching and learning environment. Students in more constructively aligned courses were more likely to adopt deep learning approaches and less likely to use surface learning approaches in their study of a particular course.},

	abstract = {This article describes research on the learning of object-oriented programming (OOP) by novices. During two academic years, we taught OOP to high school students, using Java and BlueJ. Our approach to teaching featured: objects-first, teaching composed classes relatively early, deferring the teaching of main methods, and focusing on class structure before algorithms. The research used a constructivist qualitative research methodology using observations and field notes, audio and video recordings, and an analysis of artifacts such as homework assignments. The findings were divided into four primary categories: class vs. object, instantiation and constructors, simple vs. composed classes, and program flow. In total, 58 conceptions and difficulties were identified. Nevertheless, at the end of the courses, the students understood the basic principles of OOP. The two main contributions of this research are: (i) the breadth and depth of its investigation into the concepts held by novices studying OOP, and (ii) ...}

The first isthat different teachers have different intentions concerning whatstudents will learn and consequently in their teaching they constitutethe topic or subject to be taught quite differently. The second is thata teacher's intentions concerning what it is that students should learnis closely aligned with a teacher's expectation of how students learnand how they can be helped to learn through teaching. The third is thatwhen teachers focus specifically on the teaching of a particular topic,within a specific context, there is a close relationship between theirintentions and their teaching practice. In this article we explore thesearguments through an empirical study which considers the different waysin which 26 university teachers intended to constitute a subject ortopic for their students to study, how they then taught the subject andsubsequently how consistent were their intentions and their practice.The analysis shows that when the context of teaching and learning istightly defined there is a clear relationship between a teacher'sintention and their practice. In particular, university teachers whoadopt more conceptual change and student-focussed approaches to teachingconstitute objects of study which are more relational and focus on thestudent's knowledge. Approaches which are more information transmissionand teacher-focussed constitute objects of study which are moremulti-structural and have a focus on knowledge which is as constitutedas being external to the student.},

	abstract = {A qualitative study of perception of workload found that it was very weakly related to hours of work. The complex construct was better characterised as being influenced by a broadly conceived teaching and learning environment. It appeared to be possible to encourage students to perform a great deal of highquality work, without complaining about excessive workload, by attention to this environment. This hypothesis was tested quantitatively with structural equation modelling with a sample of 3320 undergraduate students at a university in Hong Kong. The hypothesised model had nine factors of the teaching and learning environment grouped under three higherorder latent variables: teaching, teacherstudent relationships and studentstudent relationships which have influences on perceived workload. The model showed a good fit to the data, confirming the hypothesis that attention to the teaching and learning environment can spur students to work hard without feeling overly stressed. The questionnaire could be u...},

	abstract = {The relationship between university students' perceptions of their academic environment, their approaches to study, and academic outcomes was investigated at both university and faculty levels. The responses of a large, cross-disciplinary sample of undergraduate students were analysed using higher order path and regression analyses, and the results confirmed students' perceptions as influencing both 'hard' (academic achievement) and 'soft' (satisfaction, development of key skills) learning outcomes, both directly and mediated through their approaches to study. Perceptions of heavy workload and inappropriate assessment influenced students towards surface, and perceptions of good teaching towards deep, approaches to study. Students' perceptions of their current learning environment were a stronger predictor of learning outcomes at university than prior achievement at school. Protocols are proposed to guide more fine-grained analysis of students' perceptions.},

The emphasis of this study thus focuses on individual student differences and, in order to facilitate the analyses presented, a statistical procedure (multidimensional unfolding analysis) has been introduced that is new to educational research of this nature. This procedure is described in non-technical terms as well as in a more technical Appendix. The results of this study confirm the existence of the important association between qualitatively different perceptions of learning context and approaches to studying at the individual level. They illuminate, furthermore, the subtly different ways in which individual students orchestrate their approaches to studying in relation to their perception of contextual variables. The diagnostic value of an unfolding analysis is discussed and it is concluded that the methodology described in this study constitutes a pote...}

	abstract = {Practical programming is one of the basic skills pursued in computer science education. On programming courses, the coursework consists of programming assignments that need to be assessed from different points of view. Since the submitted assignments are executable programs with a formal structure, some features can be assessed automatically. The basic requirement for automated assessment is the numerical measurability of assessment targets, but semiautomatic approaches can overcome this restriction. Recognizing automatically assessable features can help teachers to create educational models, where automatic tools let teachers concentrate their work on the learning issues that need student-teacher interaction the most. Several automatic tools for both static and dynamic assessment of computer programs have been reported in the literature. This article promotes these issues by surveying several automatic approaches for assessing programming assignments. Not all the existing tools will be covered, simply be...}

Recent developments in the philosophy of science and the historical study of scientific accomplishments have deprived these presuppositions of their former plausibility. Sooner or later, this must have an effect on the teaching of science. In this paper I am presenting a brief outline of an alternative theory of knowing that takes into account the thinking organism's cognitive isolation from reality. This orientation was proposed by Vico at the beginning of the 18th century, disregarded for two hundred years, and then propounded independently by Piaget as a developmentally grounded constructivist epistemology. The paper focuses specifically on the adaptive function of cognition, Piaget's scheme theory, the process of communication, and the subjective perspective on social interaction. In the concluding section it then suggests some of the consequences the shift of epistemological presuppositions might have for the practice of teaching.},

The school divided 104 Year 7 pupils into four mixed-ability teaching groups. One of these was given enhanced formative feedback on their work for one year, but no marks or grades. The other three groups were given marks and grades with minimal comments, which was the usual prior practice in this school (and many others). Using data derived from assessment, prior attainment, pupil attitudes and background information, we conducted a contextualized analysis of progress in the four teaching groups for all subjects. This showed that progress in the treatment group (formative feedback only) was substantially inferior to that of the other three groups. In this paper, we also use data from observation of the process and from group interviews with the students involved, to help explain these results. Our findings are relevant to a consideration of the often lessened impact of re...}

	abstract = {Context High-quality learning in the context of medical education can be defined by current conceptions of a deep approach to learning and studying, in combination with metacognitive skills such as personal organisation and reflection on learning. Modern undergraduate education aims to provide an environment that will promote high-quality learning, but this is not as easy to achieve as it might at first seem. Part of the difficulty arises because it is student perceptions of the learning and assessment environment that determine the adopted approach to studying and these are notoriously hard to predict. Objective To generate a detailed understanding of aspects that facilitate and inhibit high-quality learning within an innovative, undergraduate medical programme. Methods We carried out semi-structured interviews with Year 2 undergraduate students. Results Self-directed, problem-based and vocationally relevant activities appeared to promote high-quality learning. Unanticipated barriers to high-quality learning in this setting included a perceived lack of useful feedback on learning, the assessment of applied medical knowledge for a subset of underperforming students, anatomy as a curricular topic and the quantity of information to be assimilated in medicine. Conclusions Only by understanding the barriers as they are perceived by students can we design evidence-based modifications to curricula that are likely to be successful in promoting high-quality learning.}

It has been proven practically, as this technique has resulted in better performance by students at Toin Yokohama University (TYU), Japan.}

	abstract = {Abstract During the past decade, there has been a deregulation in the Japanese higher education system caused by the mass education era. Usually, the Japanese University is difficult to get into and easy to get out of; however, recently, more universities have become more easy to get in and easy to get out of, because of the mass education era and decreased population of 18 years old students. The faculty has to face the less motivated students who come to class without the basic knowledge of science and engineering. Therefore, there is a need for changes in the teaching and learning system. A pilot study of an experimental design for assessing impact on changes in student motivation on the Japanese higher education system is presented. This paper will discuss the experiences over the last eight years from 1993 to 2001 in the course of digital circuit design of biomedical engineering study in the Toin University of Yokohama by using the Interactive Operational Control, IOC. The IOC technique combines innovative learning strategies, such as interactive and cooperative learning, with uses of the discipline, the role model, the presentation and the feedback. The students have reacted positively to this novel approach, which can be adapted to many others courses. The technique has been proven to be effective, shown by the students'grades. In this paper, the teaching strategy and responses of the students will be presented.}

A characteristic of modern assessment modes, including portfolios, is that the information they provide is often qualitative and derived from different contexts. Unambiguous, objective rating of portfolios is difficult to achieve, because the richness and uniqueness of the contents of the portfolio necessitate interpretation and taking account of the context before judgement can be passed. From this it follows that the traditional approaches and criteria for evaluating quality are no longer appropriate. We advocate the use of a hermeneutic, interpretative approach to the judging of portfolios as well as the use of quality criteria to establish trustworthiness in performing and monitoring portfolio assessment. A constructivist approach aimed at generating maximum diversity in interpretations and debate on ideas by the different stakeholders is proposed. Finally, we o...}

	abstract = {As becomes apparent in the growing literature on portfolios as assessment tools, there is a wide array of definitions and interpretations of the instrument. The prospects and benefits of portfolios being discussed increasingly call for a need to distinguish between types of portfolio. In this paper four types of portfolios are compared based on their goals and setting of use. Descriptive and evaluative data were collected as a background for comparative analyses between types of portfolio and in-depth interviews were undertaken to find out about the reasons and explanations for different portfolio use by their collectors. The analyses is focused on three criteria of portfolio use as they relate to different elements of the portfolio collection process: (i) the clarity and explicitness of the portfolio collection; (ii) the feasibility of the collection process itself; (iii) trust in the outcome of what is being collected. The study indicates that feasibility considerations are mainly responsible for differences between types, linked to an uncertainty and ambiguity on the part of the collectors to engage in the process of compilation. The trust in the portfolio instrument as a valid tool to assess abilities seems hardly affected and remained high. A major concern across different types of portfolio for all users is the feedback provided and potential use of collected information. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

The main purposes of portfolios being put forward are: documentation of performance, monitoring growth, revealing discrepancies in development and enhancing self-responsibility. The findings, however, pertain to the introductory implementation of the portfolio instrument, most notably with (student) teachers. Not much is known about the sustained use of a portfolio as an instrument to support professional development in the long term. In this study the benefits of different forms of sustained portfolio use are focused on in particular. Use is related to the portfolio's function, which can be for both professional development and certification, and to the setting and conditions of use, which may be either mandatory or voluntary. We gauge its impact on indicators like ongoing documentation, systematic reflection, dialogue with significant others and learning fo...}

This article traces the evolution of learning outcomes through rational curriculum planning to the development of expressive outcomes, and suggests a definition of learning outcomes which includes subject-based, personal transferable and generic academic outcomes. The three principal criteria of behavioural objectives are analysed in relation to learning outcomes. Outcomes may subsume learning objectives, but the two are not synonymous and learning outcomes are not fettered by the constraints of behaviourism. Learning outcomes represent what is formally assessed and accredited to the student and they offer a starting point for a viable model for the design of curricula in higher education which shifts the emphasis from input...}

The Faculties of Science at University of Aarhus and University of Southern Denmark interpreted course objectives as intended learning outcomes (ILO) and systematically formulated all such as competencies using the SOLO taxonomy that operates with five numbered progressive levels of competencies. We investigate how the formulation of ILOs using the SOLO taxonomy gives information about competence progression, educational traditions, and the nature of various science subjects. We use all the course curricula (in total 632) from the two faculties to analyze and compare undergraduate and graduate courses within each department, and different departments with each other.},

	abstract = {Abstract Computer games are an often cited motivational tool used as assignments in introductory programming courses. This paper presents the results of a study that attempts to quantify the effectiveness of computer games as programming projects over non-games. Students completed five major programming assignments during the semester in an introductory programming course. For each assignment, students were given an option between two programming projects, a game and a non-game. Throughout the term, 78.9\% of the assignments submitted by students were the game option. The average grade, however, on game assignments was 89.1\%, while the non-game average was 95.1\%. In a post-term survey 84\% of student respondents answered "yes" to the question, "Did the games provide any extra motivation for you to complete the projects with a high level of quality?" Results suggest that games do indeed provide psychological motivation and increase course enjoyment, even though they may not improve students' scores}

	abstract = {Abstract Despite the proven success of using computer video games as a context for teaching introductory programming (CS1/2) courses, barriers including the lack of adoptable materials, required background expertise (in graphics/games), and institutional acceptance still prevent interested faculty members from experimenting with this approach. Game-themed programming assignment (GTA) modules are designed specifically for these faculty members. The GTA modules are independent, and each is a self-contained game-like programming assignment that challenges students on concepts pertaining to a specific curriculum topic area. A faculty member can selectively pick and choose a subset of GTA modules to experiment with and gradually adopt the materials in his or her own classes. Each GTA module also includes a step-by-step tutorial guide that supports and encourages interested faculty to develop their own expertise and game-themed materials. This paper begins with a survey of previous results. Based on this survey, the paper summarizes the important considerations when designing materials for selective adoption. The paper then describes the design, implementation, and assessment of the GTA modules. The results from ongoing GTA workshops for CS1/2 faculty members and from a yearlong project in adopting the GTA modules in classes are then presented. In this case, the collected results verified that introductory programming concepts can be examined, practiced, and learned by means of GTA modules when neither the faculty nor the students involved have backgrounds in graphics or games. More importantly, these results demonstrated that it is straightforward to blend the GTA modules into existing classes with minimum alterations. In these ways, the GTA modules are excellent catalysts enabling faculty to begin exploring and developing their own expertise and materials to teach with games.}

	abstract = {Abstract Programming is a difficult skill to acquire. It is best learned by practice and, if students are to learn effectively, at least some of this practice have to be self-directed. Instructor's key role is to persuade our students to do this and thus to motivate them. In the past, our students identified programming as a vital skill in demand by industry. Consequently they were motivated to acquire a useful skill that would be relevant in some future job or lucrative career. Nowadays, our WEB age students have no idea why they have to study programming. Programming courses are seen simply as mandatory parts of the degree course to be negotiated. Their world of computing is multithreaded computer programs with impressive human interfaces for games and WEB. They cannot relate them with the classical programming exercises that ask for single-threaded programs performing a sequence of calculations. Given this, we decided to introduce our students in problem solving using what they view as real-world problems such as games and WEB-programming.}

	abstract = {Thematic analysis is a poorly demarcated, rarely acknowledged, yet widely used qualitative analytic method within psychology. In this paper, we argue that it offers an accessible and theoretically flexible approach to analysing qualitative data. We outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or patterns, and in relation to different epistemological and ontological positions. We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis. We conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond psychology.}
