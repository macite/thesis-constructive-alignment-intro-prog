Programming is a critical skill in Computer Science and Software Engineering, as a consequence students in these fields are taught programming from the start of their degree programmes at many Universities. Although we have been teaching programming for a number of decades, learning programming remains challenging \cite{Jenkins:2002,Lister:2004,McCracken:2001,Ragonis:2007,Robins:2003,Rountree:2002,Renumol:2010,Wiedenbeck:2005}, with a general consensus that many students find programming hard. In fact, these challenges, and the current lack of success in this critical area, were recognied by \citet{McGettrick:2005} as one of their seven grand challenges in computing education. Despite persistent efforts over many years, we are still a long way from having specific guidance on how best to approach teaching introductory programming. Attempts in the field of computing education research have focused on curriculum, pedagogy, language choice, and tool support \cite{Pears:2007}. Further afield, advancements from general education literature provides additional advice on underlying theories and practices, including works on the scholarship of teaching and learning \cite{Boyer:1990}, approaches to teaching \cite{Martin:2000}, approaches to learning \cite{Marton:1976a,Trigwell:1999}, and analysis of the learner's experience \cite{Marton:1997}. 

% While seen as beneficial, these general education theories are seen as distant from the teaching of introductory programming, and there is a need for a greater inclusion of these topics in the computing education research discourse to help engage academics teaching \IP.

\rv{Approach towards teaching IP are diverse (TODO: provide some examples and cite). However, when considered in terms of students experience of learning to program\ldots} In their study of students' experiences learning to program, \citet{Bruce:2003} categorised the way students engage with learning to program into five categories range from approaches focusing on ``\emph{getting through the unit}'', to approaches aimed at discovering what it means to be a programmer. Each of these categories can be broadly classified as either a surface or deep approach to learning \cite{Marton:1976a,Ramsden:1992} to program. When engaging surface approaches, students attempt to address the outcomes with as little effort as possible. This leads to situations in which students are primarily motivated by fear of failing, and experience the learning as a struggle, with the topic appearing tedious, hard and boring. Adjectives that are often associated with learning to program. On the other hand, when engaging deep approaches to learning students seek meaning in what they do, and relate their learning to the bigger picture. To succeed at learning to program, students need to engage deep approaches to learning, as surface approaches alone are unlikely to be sufficient \cite{Bruce:2003}.

Biggs' model of \CA \cite{Biggs:1996c,Biggs:2007}, based upon constructive learning theory (constructivism) and aligned curriculum, aims to enhance student learning outcomes by focusing on \emph{what the student does}. \CA aims to encourage students to use \emph{deep}, rather than \emph{surface}, approaches to learning. Biggs' model is student focused, with clear and intentional alignment of assessment, teaching and learning activities, and unit objectives. The focus on the central role of the learner in building meaning is derived from constructivist learning theories \todo{cite}, whilst the alignment of assessment, teaching, and learning activities, has its foundation in instructional design literature \cite{Cohen:1987} \todo{cite more}.

As a form of outcomes based teaching and learning, \CA involves defining intended learning outcomes using verbs that indicate the required cognitive level students must engage. Assessment of student work is then carried out by evaluating the Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO), using the SOLO Taxonomy developed by \citet{Biggs:1982}. \fref{constructive_alignment} illustrates the constructive alignment model presented by~\citet{Houghton:2004}, which consists of the following blocks:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Intended learning outcomes} clearly define required learning in terms of ``performances of understanding''.
  \item \emph{Performance objectives} emerge from the desired outcomes, and can be ranked to become the assessment criteria.
  \item \emph{Teaching and learning activities} are designed to place students in situations likely to elicit the required learning.
  \item Students provide \emph{evidence of their learning}, that is assessed against the criteria to determine grade outcomes.
\end{itemize}

While there is extensive literature on \CA in the general education literature, it has received little attention in computing eduction research related to teaching introductory programming.

\section{Research Goals} % (fold)
\label{sec:research_goals}

This work will look to answer the following question. In what way can \emph{constructive alignment} be applied to the teaching of \emph{introductory programming} to stimulate \emph{deep approaches learning}?

% To answer this question it is necessary to design and implement an introductory programming subject using the principles of constructive alignment. Designing such a subject requires the definition of intended learning outcomes, a statement of the assessment criteria, aligned teaching and learning activities, and a specific assessment approach. These activities require the following questions to be asked.

% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item What are appropriate intended learning outcomes?
%   \item Given the stated learning objectives, how can assessment criteria be structured to encourage students to use progressively deeper cognitive levels of activity in order to achieve higher grades? (memorise to reflect)
%   \item What teaching and learning activities help create an effective learning environment that encourages deep approaches to learning and a meaningful student experience?
%   \item How can criterion referenced assessment and holistic grading be used to assess student outcomes?
% \end{enumerate}

% To assess the effectiveness of the proposed teaching method the following questions will be addressed.

% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item Does this teaching method change the way students approach learning and/or their work in general?
%   \item What affect does this teaching method have on student engagement?
%   \item Are students able to effectively select material to demonstrate coverage of the intended learning outcomes?
%   \item To what depth does submitted work demonstrate the intended learning outcomes?
%   \item To what degree are students able to correctly assess their work against the subject's assessment criteria?
%   \item How well do students retain the knowledge and skills they develop in the subject?
% \end{enumerate}

% % Improve depth of learning.
% % 
% % Our method of teaching with constructive alignment: 
% % \begin{itemize}
% %   \item Determine learning objectives
% %   \item Create tiered assessment criterion that provide requirements for differing depths of understanding...
% %   \item Make students responsible for as much of their learning as possible. It is what they do that counts.
% %   \item Teach programming, not the language. Focus lectures on concepts and abstractions, provide just enough syntax to get the students started.
% %   \item Provide resources for students to learn the required syntax to map concepts to code (podcasts, text) to allow them to learn independently.
% %   \item Provide regular formative feedback on assessment work
% %   \item Have students prepare a portfolio of their work that demonstrates how they have addressed the assessment criteria
% % \end{itemize}
% % 
% % \bigskip
% % 
% % Guiding principles:
% % \begin{itemize}
% %   \item Truth. Remain true to the language and how it should be used. Avoid half truths as much as possible.
% %   \item Trust. Students are there to learn. They are capable and just need direction, encouragement, and feedback. Theory Y.
% %   \item Construct knowledge. Introduce the concepts needed to fully\footnote{Fully at this level of abstraction.} understand the programs they are writing. Avoid all forms of `magic'.
% %   % \item Students should use deep approaches to learning.
% %   % \item Programs are not sufficient to assess the depth of a students understanding.
% %   \item Maintain a good signal to noise ratio. Provide the essential material and have students explore the details themselves.
% %   \item Encourage deep exploration once concepts are grasped. For example, encourage students to look at how programming mechanisms work like how parameter passing works, how the stack grows, how a program's memory is organised.
% %   \item Flexible delivery with clear learning outcomes that allow students to customise the learning experience to their own needs and interests.
% %   \item Self efficacy allowing students to work toward a grade.
